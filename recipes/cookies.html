        <h2>This chewy chocolate chip biscuit recipe makes enough to keep the tins filled for the week or you can freeze some mixture for when you need a quick fix!.</h2>
        <p>Tip! 
            You can easily halve this recipe. Alternatively, roll half into a log, wrap in cling film and freeze. 
            Cut into 15 pieces while still frozen and bake (you may need to increase baking time slightly).
